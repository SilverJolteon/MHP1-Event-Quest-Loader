## Usage

Create a new folder in `ms0:/PSP/SAVEDATA/` and name it one of the following, depending on your version:

- Portable (JPN): `ULJM05066QST`

- Freedom (USA): `ULUS10084QST`

- Freedom (EUR): `ULES00318QST`

Place `MHPSP.bin` in the newly created folder and copy the contents of the respective .ini to your cheats list OR apply the ISO patch with [DeltaPatcher](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/). Then, you can access the quests from the event quest menu in the gathering hall.
 
- Freedom (EUR) **cannot** load JP quests as it will crash. You must use the English or Spanish translated quests.
- The external MHPSP.bin file is a simple concatenation of .mib quest files, each zero-padded to 0x6800 bytes in length.
